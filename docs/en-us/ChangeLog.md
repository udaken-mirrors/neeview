## 37.0 
(2020-05-29) 

### Important

- Separated the packages into x86 and x64 versions
    - Usually use the x64 version. Use the x86 version only if your OS is 32-bit.
    - We strongly recommend that you install the installer version after uninstalling the previous version.
        - The x86 version and the x64 version are treated as separate apps, and although it makes no sense, they can be installed at the same time. The x86 version overwrites the previous version.
    - Both versions support only the 32-bit Susie plugin (.spi).

- .NET framework 4.8
    - Changed the supported framework to .NET framework 4.8 . [If it doesn't start, please install ".NET Framework 4.8 Runtime" from here.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)

- Change configuration file format
    - Changed the structure of settings and changed the format to JSON. The existing XML format setting file can also be read, and automatically converted to JSON format.
    - Backward compatibility of configuration files will be maintained for about a year. In other words, the version around the summer of 2021 will not be able to read the old XML format. The same applies to the exported setting data.
